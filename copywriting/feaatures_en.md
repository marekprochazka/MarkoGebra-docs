## Features
    Graphing in the app is divided into 4 methods. Mathematical, Pie, Bar graphing and Random Noise.
    The Current graphing method is displayed in the upper left corner of the app and you can switch to
     another 
    method by clicking on it.
    In the upper right corner of the app there are 4 buttons: Graph style, delete all, save as image 
    and help referring to this documentation. 
    In the left part of the window there is a space intended for working with the graph and it's data, 
    in the right part there is a graph.

### graph style
 A graph can have several different style. Each style changes the layout part of the chart. For example 
 if it would have grid or not, if it will have axes description of which background color it will have.
 
### delete all 
This Button will delete all of the current user's inputs.
 
 ### save img
 The 'save as image button' opens a new window for saving the image. here you need to write the name of 
 the future image and specify the location of the file by clicking on the 'location' button.
 You can then decide whether you want to save the graph with the axis description or without it.
 
 ### help
 Help button will open this documentation.
 
 ## Methods 
 Each graphic method has it's specific user input, setting a graph output.
 
 ### Mathematical
 Mathematical method is divided into two outputs. The course of the function and the point. Result output depends on 
 the input type you will choose in the top left. You can either use first row with inputs for X and Y to get a point in a
 graph or a second line, where you will write the right part of the function like for example '(x + 2)/2'
 Functional inputs has some specific syntax similar to python operations, here's the allowed syntax:
  - sin, cos, tan, ln, pi, e - functions and constants
  - +, -, *, /, (, ) - operations, brackets
  - numbers - floating numbers are written with dot, not a comma
  - letter 'x' represents variable

  With each point and function input, you can choose what color you want to have in the output.

  ## Special settings of the method

  The mathematical method has two extra settings. 
  The first one is limiting values of each axis, which is in the default set to auto set. 
  And the second one is the grid setting where you can change the line type, color, and size 
  of the graph's grid. 

  ## List view

  In the list view, you can edit values from inputs and also two extra values,
   which are size and type of line/point.
