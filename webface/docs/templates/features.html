        {% blocktrans %}
            Mathematical method is divided into two outputs. The course of the function and the point. Result output
            depends on
            the input type you will choose in the top left. You can either use first row with inputs for X and Y to get
            a point in a
            graph or a second line, where you will write the right part of the function like for example '(x + 2)/2'
            Functional inputs has some specific syntax similar to python operations, here's the allowed syntax:
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>{% trans 'sin, cos, tan, ln, pi, e - functions and constants' %}</li>
            <li>{% trans '+, -, *, /, (, ) - operations, brackets' %}</li>
            <li>{% trans 'numbers - floating numbers are written with dot, not a comma' %}</li>
            <li>{% trans "letter 'x' represents variable" %}</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            {% blocktrans %}
                The mathematical method has two extra settings.
                The first one is limiting values of each axis, which is in the default set to auto set.
                And the second one is the grid setting where you can change the line type, color, and size
                of the graph's grid.
            {% endblocktrans %}
        </p>
        <p>
            {% blocktrans %}
                In the list view, you can edit values from inputs and also two extra values,
                which are size and type of line/point.
            {% endblocktrans %}
        </p>

    <h3 class="px-7per mt-15 text-left" id="pie--child">{% trans 'Pie' %}</h3>
    <div class="px-7per pt-2 text--normal"><p>
        {% blocktrans %}
            The output of the next method is the values represented in the pie chart.
            As an input, you will write the name and numeric value of the pie slice. You can also choose a color or keep
            the default blue.
            This method doesn't have any special setting.
            In the list view, you can edit input values and explode value which cause the pie slice to stump from the
            chart.
        {% endblocktrans %}

    <h3 class="px-7per mt-15 text-left" id="bar--child">{% trans 'Bar' %}</h3>
    <div class="px-7per pt-2 text--normal"><p>
        {% blocktrans %}
            Another method is called bar. In the output, the input values will be organized into a bar graph.
            As an input, you will write the name and numeric value of the bar column. You can also choose a color or
            keep the default blue.
            This method doesn't have any special setting.
            In the list view, you can edit input values and width value which sets the width of the bar column.
        {% endblocktrans %}

    </div><h3 class="px-7per mt-15 text-left" id="noise--child">{% trans 'Noise' %}</h3>
    <div class="px-7per pt-2 text--normal"><p>
        {% blocktrans %}
            The last method is random noise. As input, you will choose the dispersion of the noise and the number of
            points in it. You will create one by clicking on generate button. To get a different generation with the
            same dispersion and count values you can just click generate again. When you're satisfied with the
            generation you can lock it with the lock button.
            This method has one special setting. Same as in Math method you can edit grid here.
            In the list view, you can edit input values and the type of noise points.
